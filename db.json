      "content": "Yes, this is the best trip i've ever had. I went there July 2018 and stayed in Fira.\nOur hotel room had a view overlooking the ocean, with white sunbeds. Our days started and ended with me and my husband laying down on the sunbeds to just relax and listen to the sound of the ocean. \nThe town was crowded but peaceful at the same time. The food was soo delicious, escpecially the greek sallad.\nI really recomend this place.",
